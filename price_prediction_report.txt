Used Car Price Prediction Report
================================
Business Objective:
-------------------
Provide insights into factors influencing used car prices and build predictive models.

Data Summary:
-------------
- Features: 142
- Training Samples: 287764
- Test Samples: 71941

Model Performance:
------------------
Linear Regression:
    Test RMSE: 0.70
    R²: 0.5149

Ridge Regression:
    Test RMSE: 0.70
    R²: 0.5149

Best Model:
-----------
Linear Regression

Key Insights:
-------------
- Car age and odometer strongly influence price.
- Manufacturer and fuel type also impact pricing.
- Regularization (Ridge) slightly improves performance over Linear Regression, 

Business Interpretation:
------------------------
- Linear Regression is simpler, interpretable, and performs as well or better.
- Dealers can easily understand coefficient impacts (e.g., how car age or mileage affects price).

Recommendations:
----------------
- Focus on newer cars with lower mileage for higher resale value.
- Electric and diesel vehicles tend to have higher average prices.
- Use the saved model for inventory pricing optimization.
